For my Dear Diary Project, I'd like to parse some of the information that I've gathered over the last month. For this project I kept a record my drinking habits and kept track of the type of drink, its price and where I was drinking it.

With this data I'm going to create a visualizations of the results. More exactly I want to display what type of alcohol I drank over the month and how much I spent in total. Although I also have location data in my records, I'm struggling on how to connect this data to the narrative I'm presenting in my interface.
