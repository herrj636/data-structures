For my Dear Diary Project, I'd like to parse some of the information that I've gathered over the last month. For this project I kept a record my drinking habits and kept track of the type of drink, its price and where I was drinking it.

With this data I'm going to create a visualizations of the results. More exactly I want to display what type of alcohol I drank over the month and how much I spent in total. Although I also have location data in my records, I'm struggling on how to connect this data to the narrative I'm presenting in my interface.

By working in this project I learned that DynamoDB IS HARD. I wasn't able to access my database beyond a query that pulled one of the data points. It was time consuming to try to learn the language and the documentation available wasn't very helpful nor accurate. 

From all three final assignments, this one was the most frustrating one. Not only because of the difficulty behind learning this NoSQL language, but because it was the data that I was more curious about. As I mentioned above, I was keeping a record of how much alcoholic drinks I consume in a month. From the **[data](https://github.com/herrj636/data-structures/blob/master/final-assignment-2/data.json)** I gathered, I found that I drank a total of 58 drinks in a month, as well as other metadata such as location, price, liquor, drink and date.

I like to go drink on the weekends and I was curious to learn what type of liquour and how many drinks I had during a timespan of one month. I was also curious to get a rough estimate of how much money I spend in drinks during the month.
