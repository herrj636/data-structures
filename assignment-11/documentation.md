<p>For the Sensor project, I'm working with the a force sensitive resistor. I have create a mechanism that changes state when I'm home.</p>
<p>With this sensor data, I want to create a website that lets the user know if I'm home or not. It's a funny experiment that uses the data in a fun way, while making a critique on the 'always-connected' culture we live in today.</p>
<p>Additionally, using the data that's being recorded in through the Postgre data base, I can let the user see my weekly data and make a decision on if I'm home or not.</p>
