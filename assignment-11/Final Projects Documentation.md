<h4>AA Data Project</h4>
<p>For my AA project, I'm planning to keep it simple and accessible to users that need to access this information. Last semester I worked on a project that looked at how the homeless population in New York gets access to internet services. One of the main findings that we found is that a lot of this poeple have access to the information, but they are not literate in how to navigate this websites. Although we are not serving homeless people in this website, it does speak to how simple navigation needs to be in websites that aim to reach a diverse range of people, such as the population of New York.</p><p>Alcoholism is disease that affects a wide range of different people, and AA is an organization that aims to care for all of them. Thefore, it's very important that this website is designed to be accesible to the person who is suffering from alcoholism but hasn't reached out for help, to the recovered person who returns to the meetings for support and to continue to stay sober.</p>

<h4>Sensor Data Project</h4>
<p>For the Sensor project, I'm working with the a force sensitive resistor. I have create a mechanism that changes state when I'm home.</p>
<p>With this sensor data, I want to create a website that lets the user know if I'm home or not. It's a funny experiment that uses the data in a fun way, while making a critique on the 'always-connected' culture we live in today.</p>
<p>Additionally, using the data that's being recorded in through the Postgre data base, I can let the user see my weekly data and make a decision on if I'm home or not.</p>
