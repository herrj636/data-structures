For the Sensor project, I'm working with the a force sensitive resistor. I have create a mechanism that changes state when I'm home. As the script runs throughout the day, it gathered with very good precision when I was home or not.

With this sensor data, I want to create a website that lets the user know if I'm home or not. It's an experiment that uses the data in a fun way, while still making a critique on the 'always-connected' culture we live in today.

I wanted to take the opportunity to use the API that's available via de sensor, and leverage it to have the website change according to the data in the sensor. I took inspiration from **[Is the L Train Running?](https://isthelrunning.com/)**, and created a parody website that answers the question "Is Juan Home?".

Additionally, using the data that's being recorded through the PostgreSQL database, I can let the user see my historic data so the user can get an idea of when I might be home. However I made the data in a bar graph without specifying the times I was home. This to protect my privacy, so people know HOW much time at home, instead of WHEN I'm home.

I really enjoyed working on this project and I'd like to refine it and iterate over this version.
