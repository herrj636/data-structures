For my AA project, I'm planning to keep it simple and accessible to users that need to access this information. Last semester I worked on a project that looked at how the homeless population in New York gets access to internet services. One of the main findings that we found is that a lot of this poeple have access to the information, but they are not literate in how to navigate this websites. Although we are not serving homeless people in this website, it does speak to how simple navigation needs to be in websites that aim to reach a diverse range of people, such as the population of New York.

Alcoholism is a conidition that affects a wide range of different people, and AA is an organization that aims to care for all of them. Thefore, it's very important that this website is designed to be accesible to the person who is suffering from alcoholism but hasn't reached out for help, to the recovered person who returns to the meetings for support and to continue to stay sober.

This is the first time that I had to work with such a masive database and it was interesting to learn how to manage it without being overwhelmed by the size of database, which was a problem for me in previouse semesters. In order to create this database I had to develop my skills in Javascript and learn how to work with SQL in order to get the precise queries I want to make.
